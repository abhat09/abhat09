## üìä **Key Projects:**

### 1. **Big Data & Cloud Computing - Analyzing Expedia Flight Itinerary Data**  
- **Objective:** Analyzed flight itinerary data from Expedia to answer customer queries and predict flight fares.  
- **Methodology:** Developed a **graph-based model** to map customer queries and used regression, machine learning, and time series models to predict flight fare trends.  
- **Outcome:** Built a model capable of answering user-specific queries and determined the best model for price predictions to enhance the customer experience.

### 2. **Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing - Personalized Product Reccomendations for Household Segments**  
- **Objective:** Applied **predictive modeling techniques** to perform customer segmentation, market analysis, and product recommendations for a grocery store, improving sales and marketing strategies.  
- **Methodology:** Utilized **customer segmentation** using **k-prototypes clustering**, performed **market basket analysis** to identify product associations and frequent itemsets, and implemented **collaborative filtering** for personalized product recommendations.  
- **Outcome:** Developed tailored marketing strategies for product recommendations, personalized promotions, and cross-selling, ultimately increasing sales and improving customer satisfaction.

### 3. **Machine Learning - Employee Attrition Prediction**  
- **Objective:** Helped a company reduce employee attrition by predicting at-risk employees and providing insights into retention strategies.
- **Methodology:** Applied **K-prototypes clustering** to segment employees, then developed **logistic regression**, **GBTM**, and **RandomForest** models on each cluster. All models utilized **SMOTE** to balance the dataset and **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning. These models were compared to **cluster-wise regression** to select the best model, considering the accuracy-recall tradeoff.
- **Outcome:** Provided actionable insights into employee retention, identifying at-risk segments and offering tailored strategies to improve employee satisfaction and reduce attrition rates.

### 4. **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**  
- **Objective:** Applied various **time series forecasting models** to predict future trends based on historical data.  
- **Methodology:** Utilized **ARIMA**, **Exponential Smoothing**, **BSTS** (Bayesian Structural Time Series), and **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory networks) to develop robust forecasting models.  
- **Outcome:** Developed accurate models that predicted trends, providing actionable insights for business strategy and decision-making.

### 5. **Leadership & Consulting - Predictive Models for Revenue Optimization**  
- **Objective:** Developed and pitched predictive models to improve revenues for various client companies in the context of a consulting company.  
- **Methodology:** Applied a mix of **regression models** and **classification techniques** to forecast demand and optimize pricing strategies based on customer segmentation.  
- **Outcome:** Delivered actionable insights and model recommendations to the clients for improved decision-making.

### 6. **Statistics - Flight Delay Prediction Using Logistic Regression**  
- **Objective:** Applied **logistic regression** to predict flight delays based on historical flight data from several budget and non-budget airlines.  
- **Methodology:** Used a variety of statistical techniques, including data preprocessing and feature engineering, to build a delay prediction model.  
- **Outcome:** Optimized to reduce model error, offering valuable insights into flight delay patterns.
