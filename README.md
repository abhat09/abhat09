## 🌸 **About Me:**   
I’m currently diving deep into data science at UChicago, with a background in Statistics and Machine Learning. I have experience with biostatistics, statistical modeling, and machine learning through coursework, internships, and independent research. I’m proficient in **Python**, **R**, and **C**, with expertise in machine learning algorithms, data processing, and data visualization.

I’m passionate about applying statistical modeling, machine learning, and cloud computing to solve complex problems. Currently, I’m looking for **Summer 2025 internship opportunities** to leverage my skills in real-world projects and continue learning in dynamic, impact-driven environments.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy long walks, watching rom-coms, crocheting, knitting, and painting. 🎨🍝

## 🔍 **What I’m Looking For:**  
Last summer I had the opportunity to work as a **Software Engineering Intern** at Material Bank where I was able to analyze 6 months of consumer data in R to gain insight into product preferences, delivery regions, & product specifications across different projects, informing targeted marketing strategies. 

Now, I’m actively exploring **Summer 2025 internship** opportunities in **data science**, particularly in **statistical modeling**, **machine learning**, and **cloud-based solutions**. I’m excited to apply my skills to new industries and collaborate on impactful projects that drive innovation and strategic decision-making. 🚀
