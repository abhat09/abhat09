- **Methodology:** Fine-tuned **FaceNet**, **DenseNet-121**, **EfficientNet**, **ViT**, and **ResNet-18** models using an image dataset of cropped faces, and compared models using Pearson R coefficients. Deployed a quantized version of the final model to an app and locally-hosted website for live prediction.  
- **Outcome:** The **ResNet** model achieved the highest Pearson R coefficient of 0.660, allowing for improved accuracy over the original research paper [**Face-to-BMI**](https://aaai.org/papers/00572-14923-face-to-bmi-using-computer-vision-to-infer-body-mass-index-on-social-media/). 

### 4. [**Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing - Personalized Product Recommendations for Household Segments**](https://github.com/abhat09/abhat09/blob/masters/Customer%20Segmentation%20-%20Algorithmic%20Marketing/Customer%20Segmentation%20%26%20Recommendation%20Presentation.pdf)
- **Objective:** Applied **predictive modeling techniques** to perform customer segmentation, market analysis, and product recommendations for a grocery store, improving sales and marketing strategies.  
- **Methodology:** Utilized **customer segmentation** using **k-prototypes clustering**, performed **market basket analysis** to identify product associations and frequent itemsets, and implemented **collaborative filtering** for personalized product recommendations.  
- **Outcome:** Developed tailored marketing strategies for product recommendations, personalized promotions, and cross-selling, ultimately increasing sales and improving customer satisfaction.

### 5. [**Machine Learning 1 - Employee Attrition Prediction**](https://github.com/abhat09/abhat09/blob/masters/Employee%20Attrition%20Prediction%20-%20ML%201/IBM%20Employee%20Attrition%20Presentation.pdf)
- **Objective:** Helped a company reduce employee attrition by predicting at-risk employees and providing insights into retention strategies.
- **Methodology:** Applied **K-prototypes clustering** to segment employees, then developed **logistic regression**, **GBTM**, and **RandomForest** models on each cluster. All models utilized **SMOTE** to balance the dataset and **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning. These models were compared to **cluster-wise regression** to select the best model, considering the accuracy-recall tradeoff.
- **Outcome:** Provided actionable insights into employee retention, identifying at-risk segments and offering tailored strategies to improve employee satisfaction and reduce attrition rates.

### 6. [**Computer Vision - Style Transfer and Fake Art Detection**](https://github.com/abhat09/abhat09/blob/masters/Computer%20Vision/Final%20Presentation.pdf)  
- **Objective:** Predicted AI generated vs. human generated art using DINO and ResNet models. Additionally, applied Style Transfer using the cubism art genre. 
- **Methodology:**
Fine-tuned ResNet and DINO models for art classification. Compared classification models using **accuracy** scores. Implemented style transfer using **NeuralStyle Fast Transfer**, **VGG models**, and a **custom built CNN from scratch**. Compared models via LPIPS score. Developed a locally-hosted website for art classification and style transfer with any given image, as well as visualizing DINO's attention maps. Developed an MLOps lifecyle architecture for end-to-end deployment of this project.
- **Outcome:**
Achieved an **accuracy of 91%** with the **DINO model**, providing accurate predictions useful for identifying art authenticity. The **NeuralStyle model** achieved a low LPIPS score of 0.66, effectively transfering the cubism genre to the selected image. 

### 7. [**Time Series Analysis and Forecasting - Air Quality Index Forecasting Report**](https://github.com/abhat09/abhat09/blob/masters/AQI%20Prediction%20-%20Time%20Series/Predicting%20AQI%20Report.pdf)
- **Objective:** Predicted London‚Äôs AQI for 2025 using multiple time series forecasting models.
- **Methodology:**
Developed **ARFIMA**, **SARIMA**, **ARIMA**, **Exponential Smoothing**, **BSTS**, and **LSTM** models. Compared models by evaluating **autocorrelations**, **residual vs. fit**, and **forecast plots** for model validity and RMSE for model accuracy.
- **Outcome:**
Achieved an **RMSE of 10.2** with the **LSTM model**, providing accurate predictions useful for environmental monitoring and AQI forecasting.
