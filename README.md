# Hi, I'm Anusha! 👋

🎓 **MS-ADS student** at the University of Chicago  
🎓 **B.S. in Stats & Machine Learning** from Carnegie Mellon University (Class of 2024)

📚 **About Me:**  
I’m currently diving deep into data science at UChicago, with a background in Statistics and Machine Learning. I love working on academic projects that focus on machine learning, statistics, and computer science. This repo is where I share my **Python** and **R** projects from my courses, which cover a variety of topics ranging from predictive modeling to data visualization.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy going on long walks, relaxing with rom coms and classic sitcoms (currently rewatching *Modern Family*, and my all-time fave is *Reba*). I’m also getting into cooking, knitting, crocheting, and painting! 🎨🍝

🔍 **What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m actively exploring **Summer 2025 internship** opportunities for data science roles where I can apply my skills and gain hands-on experience in solving real-world problems with data. 🚀
