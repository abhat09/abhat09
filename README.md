## 🌸 **About Me:**   
I’m currently diving deeper into data science at UChicago, with a background in Statistics and Machine Learning. I have experience with biostatistics and predictive analytics through coursework, internships, and independent research. I’m proficient in **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, and **C**, with expertise in machine learning algorithms, data processing, and data visualization.

I’m passionate about applying statistical modeling, machine learning, and cloud computing to solve complex problems. Currently, I’m looking for opportunities to leverage my skills in real-world projects and continue learning in a dynamic, impact-driven environment.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy long walks, rewatching old sit-coms, crocheting, knitting, and painting. 🎨🍝

## 🔍 **What I’m Looking For:**  
Last summer I had the opportunity to work as a **Software Engineering Intern** at Material Bank where I was able to analyze 6 months of consumer data in R to gain insight into product preferences, delivery regions, & product specifications across different projects, informing targeted business and marketing strategies. 

Now, I’m actively exploring **Summer 2025 internship** opportunities in **data science**, particularly in **statistical modeling**, **machine learning**, and **cloud-based solutions**. I’m excited to apply my skills to new industries and collaborate on impactful projects that drive innovation and strategic decision-making. 🚀
