## 📚 **Education:**  

🎓 **M.S. in Applied Data Science student** at the University of Chicago  
🎓 **B.S. in Stats & Machine Learning**, minor in Biological Sciences, from Carnegie Mellon University (Class of 2024)  

This repository contains the projects I’ve worked on during my Bachelor's and Master’s programs, showcasing my skills in predictive modeling, machine learning, big data and cloud computing, computer programming, and consulting. Below are some key highlights of my work:

## 🌸 **About Me:**   
I’m currently diving deep into data science at UChicago. My journey so far has taken me through biostatistics, predictive analytics, and independent research—sharpening my skills in **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, and **C**, with hands-on experience in machine learning, data wrangling, and visualization.

I’m especially passionate about using data to uncover product insights and solve complex business problems. Whether it’s statistical modeling, machine learning, or cloud-based tools, I love turning messy data into clear strategy.

When I’m not neck-deep in data, you’ll probably find me on a long walk, rewatching old sitcoms, knitting something cozy, or painting very poorly just for fun. 🎨📚🍝
