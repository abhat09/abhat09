## 🌸 **About Me:**   

I’m currently pursuing data science at the University of Chicago, with experience in biostatistics, predictive analytics, and independent research. I have strong skills in **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, and **C**, and hands-on experience with machine learning, data wrangling, visualization, and cloud computing.

I’m passionate about using data to extract actionable insights and solve real-world business problems. My focus is on applying statistical modeling, machine learning, and cloud tools to turn complex data into clear strategies.

Outside of work, I enjoy long walks, watching classic sitcoms, knitting, and painting for relaxation. 🎨📚🍝
