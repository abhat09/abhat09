Project Description:

For my project, I aimed to recreate the dining games Flo's Diner and Penguin Diner.
During the game, the player acts as the restaurant's waiter and has to serve the
customers that come to the restaurant. Fully serving customers includes seating them,
taking their order, and delivering their food. Each customer begins with 5 hearts
(indicating their patience level) and they lose hearts as time goes on but gain 
them back if they are served/helped. Thus, the object of the game is to fully serve 
as many customers as possible before either the wait line gets too long or a customer
loses all their hearts and leaves the restaurant. The game also ends if a customer is served
the wrong order.




Running the codebase:

The python file for the project can be run in VScode. The program requres several images 
and CMU 15-112 Graphics to be downloaded to the same folder as the python file
(these are included in the tp3 folder within the submission folder). Make sure you
are connected to the internet as some images are loaded via a url. 
-- Image files are: foodItem1, foodItem2, foodItem3, foodItem4, foodItem5, instructionsGraphic,
menuGraphics, restaurFloor, exclaimation, dinerPhoto, customer, customerheart, waiter,
and tableImage (total of 14 image files).
