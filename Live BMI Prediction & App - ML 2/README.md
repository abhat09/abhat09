Project Description

This repository contains the codebase for our ML 2 final project. The goal of the project is to create a model that outperforms the paper *Face-to-BMI* which utilizes VGG-Net and VGG-Face models to predict BMI from image data. We experimented with several models (EfficientNet, ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, VGG-Face, and Vision Transformers), finding that ResNet-18 performs the best, achieving a pearson r correlation of 0.66 for the test set. We deployed the final model to an app for live BMI prediction. BMI can be predicted in the app by feeding an image to the model or utilizing the front camera.
